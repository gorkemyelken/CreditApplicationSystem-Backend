<h1 align="center">DefineX Java Spring Practicum Final Case - Backend</h1>
<p>Writing a restful application for a Credit Application System, which will take the credit application requests and return the credit result to the customer according to the relevant criteria, using the Spring Boot framework and optionally writing the frontend.</p>
<p>With the identity number, name-surname, monthly income, phone information and date of birth, the credit score service that is assumed to have been written before goes to the credit score service and the credit score of the relevant person is obtained and the credit result is shown to the user according to the following rules. (There may be two options as Approval or Rejection.)</p>

### üö® Rules
---

üìå New customers can be defined in the system, existing customers can be updated or deleted.

üìå If the credit score is below 500, the customer will be rejected. (Credit result: Rejected)

üìå If the credit score is between 500 and 1000, the monthly income is below 5000 TL, the customer's credit application is approved and a 10,000 TL limit is assigned to the customer. (Credit Result: Approved)

If the customer has given deposit, 10% of the deposit amount is added to the credit limit.

üìå If the credit score is between 500 and 1000, the monthly income is between 5000 TL and 10,000 TL, the credit application of the customer is approved and a limit of 20,000 TL is assigned to the customer. (Credit Result: Approved)

If the customer has given deposit, 20% of the deposit amount is added to the credit limit.

üìå If the credit score is between 500 and 1000, the monthly income is over 10.000 TL, the credit application of the customer is approved and a limit of MONTHLY INCOME * CREDIT LIMIT MULTIPLIER/2 is assigned to the customer. (Credit Result: Approved)

If the customer has given deposit, 25% of the deposit amount is added to the credit limit.

üìå If the credit score is equal to or above 1000, the credit application of the customer is approved and a limit of MONTHLY INCOME * CREDIT LIMIT MULTIPLIER is assigned to the customer. (Credit Result: Approved)

If the customer has given deposit, 50% of the deposit amount is added to the credit limit.

üìå As a result of the conclusion of the credit application, the application is recorded in the database. Afterwards, an informative SMS is sent to the relevant phone number; the approval status information (rejection or approval) and limit information is returned from the endpoint.

üìå A completed credit application can only be queried with the identity number and date of birth. If the date of birth and identity number information do not match, it should not be questioned.

üìå Note: The credit limit multiplier is 4 by default.
